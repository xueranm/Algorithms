# Algorithms

Introduction:

One course includes topologic sort, Kruskal's and Prim's methods,sssp, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra's algorithm, shortest paths and matrix multiplication, Floyd-Warshall algorithm, dynamic programming, matrix chain multiplication, longest common subsequence, optimal BSTs, greedy algorithms, task scheduling, Huffman codes, entropy, divide and conquer, disjoint sets, NP-completeness and so on. 


Another Course: First, we will briefly review loop invariants, recursion, asymptotic complexity notation and recurrence equations, as well as the basic linear data types. Then, we will discuss rooted ordered trees and their usage, especially as search structures. We will conclude with some basic sorting algorithms using the newly introduced data structures. The objective of the course is to acquire facility using tools to analyze (and design!) algorithms (computational complexity, proofs of correctness) and structuring the information manipulated by the algorithms.
